in spring 
spring core- dependency injectons, IOC container
Spring Wep , Data JPA.

there are some draw backs in spring like:
-> Compatibility issues with libraries.
-> Manual configuration required(DataSource, JDBCTemplate, Transaction Manager, etc).
-> Deployment only on external servers.
Thats the reason Spring boot is introduced

SPRING BOOT
===========
Open-source Java-based framework(By Pivotal)
Built on top of Spring Framework
Minimal configuration required
Create stand-alone, production-ready application
Supports java, kotlin, Groovy
Runs with embedded servers(Tomcat/Jetty)
Provides Actuators for monitoring
Increases productivity & reduces development time

Features of Spring Boot
======================
Spring Boot Staters(dependency management)
Auto Configuration (@EnableAutoConfiguration)
Spring Boot Annotations
Spring Boot Actuators
Logging Support
Custom Banner

Pre-configured dependency packages
Single-dependency libraries(convenience)

There are 2 types to create the project in spring boot 
spring initializer and spring sts 
Most of them uses spring sts as it is easy to download and set the project
where as Spring initializer we should go to browser and set up the project and initialize the dependencies as per the requirement
